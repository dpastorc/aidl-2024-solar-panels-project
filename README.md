## Introduction and motivation

TODO: get from first slides presented to Amanda.

## Dataset

TODO: Information about datasets used (size, spatial-resolution, source, etc.)

## Models used

TODO: Explain why we have used two models.

### Unet

#### Architecture

TODO: Specify the architecture used and relevant details.

#### Experiments

| # | Hypothesis | Setup | Result | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Baseline | bla | Avg. Loss = xxx<br>Avg.Accuracy = yyy<br>Dice = xxx<br>Jaccard = xxxx | bla |
| 1 | bla | bla | Avg. Loss = xxx<br>Avg.Accuracy = yyy<br>Dice = xxx<br>Jaccard = xxxx | bla |
